Hyde Park woman accused of vandalizing headstones at Mattapan cemetery,"BOSTON (WHDH) - A woman is facing a vandalism charge after police say she was caught acting suspiciously in a Hyde Park cemetery.

Officers who spotted Deborah Gideon, 53, of Hyde Park tossing what appeared to be red powder into the air in the area of 19 Millstone St. about 4:45 p.m. Thursday followed her to Mount Hope Cemetery, where they saw her approach several headstones and make a tossing motion with her hand, according to Boston police.

When officers stopped her car further in the cemetery, they allegedly found her to be in possession of a spray bottle, a gallon of a reddish liquid, containers of various colored salt, powered-juice mixes, and olive oil.

She will be arraigned Friday in West Roxbury District Court on charges of attempting to commit a crime to wit, vandalism of a gravestone and malicious destruction of property over $1,200.

Her arrest comes a little more than a week after police launched an investigation into damaged statues at local cemeteries. One of those incidents occurred in mid-March when five memorials were vandalized at Mount Hope Cemetery, where Gideon was arrested a month later.

Last Wednesday, officers responded to a reported vandalism at St. Gregory’s Parish church on Dorchester Avenue and found that someone had defaced a religious statue by covering it in an unknown red substance.

Several rescued from Charles River after 2 boats capsize,"BOSTON (WHDH) - Two boats capsized in the Charles River Friday morning, sending several people into the cold, choppy water.

Crews responding to the Longfellow Bridge area around 7:30 a.m. rescued an undisclosed amount of people who had fallen into the river after their boat capsized due to windy conditions, Cambridge fire officials said.

About 15 minutes later, crews responded to another report of a capsized boat near 409 Memorial Drive and found nine people in the water. They were picked up by Marine Unit 1 and brought to the pier.

No injuries were reported but those rescued are being evaluated by medical personnel for hypothermia.

Driver charged after car with child passenger barrels into storefront of Brockton gas station,"BROCKTON, MASS. (WHDH) - A 24-year-old woman is facing several charges after police say she crashed her car into the storefront of a Brockton gas station Thursday night with a man and a child in the backseat of her vehicle.

The driver, whose name has not been released, was charged with reckless operation of a motor vehicle, destruction of property valued above $1,200 and committing a marked lanes violation after losing control of her car on Belmont Street just after 10 p.m., Brockton police said.

The male passenger and his son who were in the backseat of the car allegedly exited the vehicle and fled before emergency crews arrived.

Panicked neighbor Donna Russano was sitting in her room when she heard a car horn screeching followed by a big bang.

She ran outside to see what happened and found a car partially inside the Belmont Street gas station.

“The car was in the building and there was woman sitting there with the fire truck and screaming,” Russano recalled.

The scene shocked Russano, who thought the crash involved multiple cars in the roadway.

“It sounded like it was in the road, it really did,” she said. “I thought it was numerous cars the way it sounded. It literally sounded, even my neighbor upstairs said, it sounded like it was in the street.”

Police say the driver suffered minor injuries and was transported to Good Samaritan Medical Center for treatment.

“I was just in shock. I just wanted to make sure no one was hurt really bad and needed help,” Russano said.

The building sustained serious damage and has since been boarded up.

House subpoena for Mueller report escalates investigation,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena Friday for special counsel’s Robert Mueller’s report as Congress escalates its investigation of President Donald Trump.

“It now falls to Congress to determine the full scope of that alleged misconduct and to decide what steps we must take going forward,” said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. He expects the Justice Department to comply by May 1.

While Mueller declined to prosecute Trump on obstruction of justice, he did not exonerate the president, all but leaving the question to Congress.

Mueller’s report provides fresh evidence of Trump’s interference in the Russia investigation and challenges lawmakers to respond. The risks for both parties are clear if they duck the responsibility or prolong an inquiry that, rather than coming to a close, may be just beginning.

“My committee needs and is entitled to the full version of the report and the underlying evidence consistent with past practice,” Nadler said in a statement.

Attorney General William Barr sent Congress a redacted version of the report, blacking out several types of material, including classified information, material pertaining to ongoing investigations and grand jury evidence.

Nadler said he is open to working with the department “to reach a reasonable accommodation for access to these materials, however I cannot accept any proposal which leaves most of Congress in the dark, as they grapple with their duties of legislation, oversight and constitutional accountability.”

The materials are due the day Barr is scheduled to testify before a Senate committee and one day before Barr is set to appear before Nadler’s committee. Nadler also has summoned Mueller to testify.

Republicans are eager to move beyond what Trump calls the “witch hunt” that has overshadowed the party and the presidency. While Democrats say Mueller’s findings are far more serious than initially indicated in Barr’s four-page summary last month, they’ve been hesitant to pursue the ultimate step, impeachment proceedings, despite pressure from the left flank of the party to begin efforts to try to remove the president from office.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, traveling Thursday on a congressional trip to Ireland, said in a joint statement with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer that Mueller’s report revealed more than was known about the obstruction question.

“As we continue to review the report, one thing is clear: Attorney General Barr presented a conclusion that the president did not obstruct justice while Mueller’s report appears to undercut that finding,” they said.

Later, in a letter to House Democrats, Pelosi vowed: “Congress will not be silent.”

It’s unlikely that the full Mueller report or the public testimony will untangle the dilemma that Democrats face. Mueller laid out multiple episodes in which Trump directed others to influence or curtail the Russia investigation after the special counsel’s appointment in May 2017, and Trump made clear that he viewed the probe as a potential mortal blow — “the end of my presidency.”

Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the acts described in the report “whether they are criminal or not, are deeply alarming in the president of the United States. And it’s clear that special counsel Mueller wanted the Congress to consider the repercussions and the consequences.”

Schiff, D-Calif., said that “if the special counsel, as he made clear, had found evidence exonerating the president, he would have said so. He did not. He left that issue to the Congress of the United States.”

Republicans sought to portray Democrats as unwilling to let go of the idea that Trump colluded with Russia to swing the election. “What you’re seeing is unprecedented desperation from the left,” tweeted Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a top Trump ally. “There was no collusion. It’s over.”

Other Republicans were more measured. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is one of the few members of Congress mentioned in the report, told reporters in Kentucky, “It’s too early to start commenting on portions of it.”

McConnell was among several people the report said former White House Counsel Don McGahn had reached out to on behalf of the president when Trump was trying to stop then Attorney General Jeff Sessions from recusing himself at the start of the Russia probe.

In all, the report revealed 10 areas of potential obstruction, from Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey to his attempts to thwart Mueller’s investigation. In many cases, the additional details show a president restrained only by aides and others around him.

Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a member of the Judiciary Committee, said his reading of the report shows that Trump “almost certainly obstructed justice” and it was only his staff intervened to prevent certain actions.

2 hospitalized after multi-alarm fire torches home in Dorchester,"BOSTON (WHDH) - Two residents were taken to the hospital after a two-alarm blaze torched a home in Dorchester on Thursday afternoon.

Crews responding to a reported building fire at the corner of Bowdoin and Dever streets shortly before 4 p.m. found heavy flames shooting from the roof of a multi-story home and thick smoke overtaking the area, according to the Boston Fire Department.

Video from the scene showed several people rescuing a man from a second-floor window and safely bring him to the ground.

“He said he climbed through the roof and he saw him through the window, so he pulled him out of the window,” one man said.

Through a translator, Alfred Jimenze says he and his co-workers ran from a barber shop on Bowdoin Street when they saw smoke.

“He said in the moment he wasn’t scared, he just wanted to help him out,” he said.

A woman on the second floor was able to jump, and she was caught by a crowd of people.

“The guy, he couldn’t make it because he was so sick. The smoke (went) through his body probably. He almost died,” one witness said.

The group helped push Jimenze up onto the roof to get the man out.

They carried the man away from all the smoke and stayed with him until first responders arrived.

“It’s very good because you help somebody when they need help, and if we need to do it again, we’ll do it again,” a man said.

Photos from the scene showed several firefighters attacking the blaze from the ground and on ladders.

The fire has since been knocked down. Crews are overhauling the burned-out home.

The conditions of those who were taken to the hospital were not immediately available.

Officials estimated the damage to the home at about $500,000.

The cause of the fire is under investigation.

New Bedford doctor accused of paying 14-year-old boy for sexual activity held on $75K bail,"ATTLEBORO, MASS. (WHDH) - A New Bedford doctor accused of paying a 14-year-old for sexual activity was ordered held on $75,000 bail Thursday.

Sujan Kayastha, 37, a hospitalist at St. Luke’s Hospital in New Bedford, was arraigned in Attleboro District Court on charges including possession of child pornography, two counts of disseminating obscene matter to a minor, two counts of electronic enticement of a child for prostitution, and trafficking of a person for sexual servitude.

A four-month-long investigation led to Kayastha’s arrest Wednesday.

Juvenile Det. Joseph Daday began investigating Kayastha after receiving a report in December 2018 that the Attleboro boy had been sexually assaulted, according to Attleboro police.

The execution of multiple search warrants on mobile devices and several social media accounts led Daday to Kayastha, who allegedly engaged in lengthy and sexually explicit communications with the juvenile victim that included the transmission of child pornography.

Kayastha offered drugs, money, and alcohol to the boy and made arrangements to bring him to a hotel in Seekonk to engage in a sexual encounter, police said.

Detectives executing a search warrant at Kayastha’s Dartmouth home on Wednesday arrested him without incident.

Kayastha allegedly made admissions and incriminating statements while being interviewed by investigators.

Police searching both Kayastha and the victim’s phones say the doctor knew the child was underage because the boy said so in his online conversations.

Detectives seized multiple mobile communications devices that contained child pornography, as well as suspected narcotics, according to police.

His neighbors were shocked by the allegations.

“You don’t expect it in your neighboorhood,” one woman said. “It can happen to anyone, anywhere, any class. He was a physician.”

Another neighbor said, “It’s enough to make me cry.”

In a statement, Southcoast Health said, “We are disturbed to learn of the allegations and arrest of Dr. Sujan Kayastha. Dr. Kayastha has immediately been relieved of his duties pending review of this matter. We are unable to comment further at this time.”

If Kayastha posts bail, he cannot leave the state or use social media, and he must stay away from the victim and anyone under the age of 18.

The investigation remains ongoing and police say further criminal charges may follow.

"Attorneys accuse police, prosecutors of leaking Kraft video","WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Attorneys for two of the women charged in a Florida prostitution sting asked a judge on Thursday to hold police and prosecutors in contempt of court following reports that someone was shopping around undercover video of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.

The motion was filed in Palm Beach County Circuit Court by attorneys for Lei Wang and Hua Zhang, who are accused of working at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter.

The attorneys cited a New York Daily News story that reports an unknown person had contacted TheBlast.com with footage of Kraft naked with another person, presumably the massage therapist. The attorneys said only police and prosecutors have access to the footage, which a judge has temporarily barred from release. The attorneys argued that releasing the footage would violate their clients’ rights to privacy and fair trials.

Jupiter police spokesman O’Neil Anderson told The Associated Press that he doubts the authenticity of the reports. He said his department has taken every precaution to secure the evidence, and he doesn’t believe anyone in the police department or State Attorney’s Office would leak the video.

Anderson also pointed out that no websites or news organizations have actually shown a video.

“If anyone had it, they would have released it by now,” Anderson said.

Kraft was charged in February with two misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution after being accused of paying for sex. He has pleaded not guilty.

A message left with the State Attorney’s Office wasn’t immediately returned.

"Bobcat that attacked golfer, horse in Connecticut had rabies","SPRAGUE, Conn. (AP) — A bobcat that attacked a golfer in Connecticut shortly after scratching a horse has tested positive for rabies.

The bobcat was shot and killed by state environmental police shortly after it attacked a man on the Mohegan Sun Golf Course in Sprague on Thursday morning.

The state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection in a statement said the wildcat was taken for testing at the UConn Medical Lab, which confirmed rabies.

The golfer and the horse owner have been notified.

The golfer, a man in his 60s whose name was not made public, was treated at a hospital for scratches.

Bobcats are common in Connecticut, but attacks on humans are unusual. The last report of a bobcat attack on a human in the state was in Bozrah in August 2014.

Girl on spring break trip stumbles upon 3 million-year-old megalodon shark tooth,"(CNN/WHDH) — A girl who celebrated her spring break at the beach just happened to stumble upon a megalodon shark tooth, which could date back more than three million years.

Avery Fauth found the tooth on Monday as she walked along North Topsail Beach in North Carolina, according to WECT-TV.

Fauth’s father had been looking for a megalodon tooth for more than 20 years and got her and her sisters interested in hunting for shark teeth.

Fauth told the news outlet that she was down by the water when she saw something in the sand. When she pulled out the black tooth, everyone started screaming.

“We were all kind of like jumping up and down and screaming really loud And my dad didn’t believe us at first,” she said. “I was Facetiming people and they said that we bought it. They kind of didn’t believe us but then whenever I came back and showed them, they said it was really cool.”

The megalodon was the largest shark ever documented and went extinct about 3.6 million years ago.

It was formerly thought to be a member of the family Lamnidae, making it closely related to the great white shark.

Solve It 7: Trip to Disney for princess-in-training,"It’s called the most magical place on Earth.

A trip to Disney World is a dream destination for children everywhere, including five-year-old Winni Iapicca, of Danvers.

“She’s a little girl with a princess attitude who just wants to dream and believe,” says her mother, Lyssa.

But life’s been tough for this little girl. Winni was born with tuberous sclerosis complex, a rare genetic disorder affecting her lungs, kidneys, brain, eyes, and skin. Lyssa says she takes the challenges head-on and with a vibrant spirit. So her parents decided to make her dream of going to Disney World a reality. They booked a family trip to celebrate her fifth birthday.

“No matter what her life is going to be, we want to make it as dreamy as possible for her,” Lyssa says.

Winni had never flown before, so Lyssa wanted to make sure she booked a flight that would work best for her daughter. Crowds of people and large gatherings can cause anxiety for Winni.

“We really have to prepare,” Lyssa says. “We have to have extra time just to go to the grocery store.”

Earlier last year, Lyssa went online and booked a 12:30 p.m. direct flight from Boston to Orlando on Delta Airlines. It would give them the extra time they needed for Winni. The Iapicca’s planned to get to the airport four to five hours early to give Winni enough time to get acclimated. The flights cost $2,300 for the family of four.

Everything was going according to plan until a few months before their big trip.

“I received an email that the flight all together had been canceled,” Lyssa says.

Lyssa says the Delta representative gave her two options: a 6 a.m. direct flight or an evening flight with a layover. Neither option would work because of her daughter’s condition.

“They just kept saying, ‘Unfortunately, I’m so sorry for your situation…there’s nothing we can do,’” Lyssa remembers.

She found a similar early afternoon flight on a different airline, but it cost more than $4,000. Wanting to keep their Disney dream alive, she reached out to Solve It 7.

We called Delta. The airline told us they would contact Lyssa directly to try and figure out a solution. Lyssa says she got a call back within hours.

A Delta executive told Lyssa to book whatever flight she needed, send an invoice and Delta would write her a check. She booked the flight on the other airline and Delta took care of the cost. They also gave the family a $500 Amazon gift card for their troubles.

“We know how important family vacations like this are,” the company said in a statement provided to Solve It 7. “While scheduled adjustments like this are uncommon, Delta employees are empowered to work with customers to find solutions.”

Winni got to take her trip of a lifetime. One home video shows the five-year-old in a pink dress meeting Cinderella. Another shows Lyssa and Winni riding a roller coaster, all smiles.

“She saw every princess, filled two autograph books, it was a dream,” says Lyssa.

A dream come true for this princess in training.

“I want to thank [Solve It 7] tremendously for helping us have an amazing, successful trip to Disney World,” Lyssa says. “And giving her the dreams that she deserves.”

Sheriff’s officer corrals donkey on interstate near Chicago,"ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. (AP) — It wasn’t a routine day for a sheriff’s officer after she spotted a donkey meandering along Interstate 90 near Chicago.

Video from a body camera taken Wednesday shows the bewildered Cook County officer radioing: “There’s a donkey in the middle of I-90.”

The officer then ordered the donkey to “come here, sweetie.”

She asked a motorist to stand with the donkey while she could figure out what to do.

The officer also asked the donkey where it was from. It turns out the animal’s name was Dusty, who was eventually returned to its owner.

Dramatic rescue caught on camera after pontoon boat capsizes in Florida,"(WHDH) — More than a dozen people were pulled from the water in a dramatic rescue after a pontoon boat capsized off the coast of Florida on Sunday.

The boat was out in choppy seas despite a boating advisory that had been issued near the Tampa area.

Passenger Allona Haynes says she thought she wasn’t going to make it.

“Luckily my dad saved me and dragged me to the boat and I got one of the seat cushions to hold me up,” she said. “I thought I was going to drown.”

The Pasco Sheriff’s Office says those on board should have listened to the boating advisory.

“It was a lot rougher than you think,” said Corporal Russ Meissner. “It was probably 25 mile-per-hour winds. That specific area was 3-foot waves. We took a beating just trying to get to that scene.”

Several people who ended up in the water didn’t have life jackets and many admitted they didn’t know how to swim, which created even more panic.

“We had one guy in the water without a life jacket at all holding a duffel bag,” said Corporal Mitch Boloenbacher. “One person was holding on to a life jacket but didn’t have the life jacket on correctly.”

“Even us who could swim, it was so hard,” said Loryn Decker, who was among those rescued. “I was treading water for 20 minutes.”

Sheriff Chris Nocco is thankful everyone is safe, and he’s using the incident as a lesson going into the summer season.

“Wear your vests,” Nocco said.

Jet and Jasmine, rescued from an overcrowded shelter in Alabama with their four babies, are looking for a new home together. Their bond is so strong, their foster says, that they howl whenever they are separated until they are reunited.

“So what do you do when you’ve got two crazy kids in love? You make it official!,” the organization wrote in a post on Facebook. “Yesterday, we celebrated Jet and Jasmine’s love, support, and bond with one another. They exchanged bow-wows, licked faces, and shared their first romp around the yard as a married couple. Now honeymooning in Hopkinton, J+J are hoping to relocate somewhere permanent to start their next chapter of life.”

Their foster parent said, “Their bond is undeniable. They really do howl if they are separated. They are shy at first, but Jet warms up quickly with treats. Jasmine takes more time to come around. I think the only love they’ve ever known is from each other. Once you’ve won them over, they love getting attention and being scratched. They deserve adopters who will love and take care of them forever.”

Jet and Jasmine are available to meet by appointment in Hopkinton.

Athol man pleads guilty in death of 10-year-old boy with autism,"GREENFIELD, Mass. (AP) — A Massachusetts man has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the death of his girlfriend’s 10-year-old autistic and deaf son.

Christopher Vinsant, of Athol, had originally faced a murder charge in the July 2013 death of Isaiah Buckner, but under a deal with prosecutors, pleaded guilty Thursday to the lesser charge and was sentenced to up to 10 years of prison.

Prosecutors say the 32-year-old Vinsant was the boy’s primary caregiver the day he died of what were described as severe injuries to his abdomen and internal organs.

Vinsant said the boy fell earlier in the day, but authorities say Vinsant waited hours to get the boy help even though he was in “excruciating” pain.

The boy’s mother in a victim impact statement said “The joy of my life is gone.”

Beverly man who sent white powder to Trump’s sons to be sentenced,"BOSTON (AP) — Prosecutors are seeking three years in prison for a Beverly, Massachusetts man who admitted to sending threatening letters filled with white powder to President Donald Trump’s sons and others.

Daniel Frisiello is set to be sentenced Friday in Boston federal court. He pleaded guilty in October.

The letter Frisiello sent to Donald Trump Jr. was opened last year by his now-ex-wife, Vanessa. She was briefly hospitalized as a precaution after she reported feeling ill. The substance turned out to be nonhazardous.

Other recipients of Frisiello’s letters included Democratic U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.

Frisiello’s lawyer is seeking five years of probation, including one year of home confinement. His lawyer says the 25-year-old has developmental delays, is autistic and would be susceptible to “exploitation, violence and isolation” in prison.

Chem professor on leave after Nazi gas chamber exam question,"MIDDLEBURY, Vt. (AP) — A Middlebury College chemistry professor whose written exam question asked students to calculate the lethal dose of a poisonous gas used in Nazi gas chambers during the Holocaust has taken a leave of absence, the school said.

The Vermont liberal arts college said that it’s investigating under the terms of its faculty misconduct policy.

“This inexplicable failure of judgment trivializes one of the most horrific events in world history, violates core institutional values, and simply has no place on our campus,” wrote Middlebury President Laurie Patton last week. “We expect our faculty to teach and lead with thoughtfulness, good judgment, and maturity. To say we have fallen short in this instance is an understatement.”

A review of past exams given by professor Jeff Byers found a second objectionable question making reference to the Ku Klux Klan in an exam given last year. The question appeared to have a humorous intent, but “was gratuitous and offensive,” the school said.

Byers apologized to the college community in an April 10 written statement on the school’s website. He said he gave two exams in the last year that included questions “that were clearly offensive, hurtful, and injurious to our students.”

“I can offer no explanation for my actions other than carelessness and hubris,” he wrote.

The gas chamber exam question came to light in the student-run satirical newspaper, The Local Noodle , according to the student-run newspaper, The Middlebury Campus.

The school’s Community Bias Response Team, which is charged with assessing and responding to bias incidents, sent out a campus-wide email criticizing both the exam question and The Local Noodle for making light of it, The Middlebury Campus reported.

An email sent to a Jewish student group and local Jewish congregation seeking comment was not immediately returned.

On Thursday, Patton, the college president, said in a campus-wide email that the college has experienced several incidents of bias in recent weeks “that are causing pain and anger in our community,” but did not specify what those were. She was following up on the school’s decision Wednesday to cancel a lecture by conservative Polish politician Ryszard Legutko because of safety concerns.

Health care aide charged with stealing from dementia patient,"SHELTON, Conn. (AP) — A Connecticut home health aide has been charged with stealing more than $20,000 from an elderly dementia patient she was caring for.

Police say 30-year-old Jennifer Poitevien, of Shelton, was charged Wednesday with first-degree larceny, credit card theft and first-degree identity theft.

Police were tipped off by a man who said his 83-year-old mother, who suffers from dementia, was missing “a large sum of money from her bank accounts.”

Police say their investigation found that Poitevien made ATM withdrawals with the victim’s credit card and opened another card in the victim’s name.

Poitevien is charged with stealing about $22,000 from the victim’s since April 2018.

She was held on $5,000 bond. It’s not clear if she has a lawyer.

The agency that employed her has fired her.

VT chem professor on leave after Nazi gas chamber exam question,"MIDDLEBURY, Vt. (AP) — A Middlebury College chemistry professor whose written exam question asked students to calculate the lethal dose of a poisonous gas used in Nazi gas chambers during the Holocaust has taken a leave of absence.

The Vermont college said in a written statement last week that it’s investigating under the terms of its faculty misconduct policy.

Professor Jeff Byers apologized to the university community in an April 10 written statement on the college’s website. He says he gave two exams in the last year containing questions that were “clearly offensive, hurtful, and injurious” to students, blaming his actions on “carelessness and hubris.”

Middlebury President Laurie Patton says “this inexplicable failure of judgment trivializes one of the most horrific events in world history” and has no place on Middlebury’s campus.

"Hospital mistakenly emailed patient names, prescriptions","BANGOR, Maine (AP) — A Maine psychiatric hospital says the release of confidential information about 300 people receiving medication-assisted drug treatment to a newspaper was an “isolated” mistake.

The Bangor Daily News reports that Northern Light Acadia Hospital in Bangor mistakenly emailed the names of 300 patients with prescriptions for Suboxone, a medication used to treat opioid use disorder. The list included the patients’ names and their doctors.

Acadia’s president, Scott Oxley, called the blunder this month “a huge deal” but said the “isolated” mistake stemmed from human error, not a systemic problem.

The mistake could lead to an audit of the hospital’s privacy and security protocols. Acadia is required to report the incident to federal regulators.

Northern Lights Acadia Hospital provides both inpatient and community-based psychiatric care and substance use treatment programs.

NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — “Real Housewives of New Jersey” husband Joe Giudice has lost his appeal to avoid deportation to Italy.

His attorneys said Thursday they are “extremely disappointed” by the Board of Immigration’s decision and have appealed to the federal circuit court in Philadelphia.

Giudice and his wife, Teresa, pleaded guilty in 2014 to financial fraud. Giudice is an Italian citizen who was brought to the U.S. as a baby and says he wasn’t aware he wasn’t an American citizen.

Teresa Giudice served nearly a year in prison and was freed in December 2015. Joe Giudice was released from prison last month and was sent to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in southeast Pennsylvania.

Woman gets jail for running over son in school parking lot,"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) — A woman who pleaded guilty to reckless driving for running over her 9-year-old son while dropping him off at school in Michigan has been ordered to serve 30 days in jail.

Thirty-six-year-old Tiffany Kosakowski told Kent County Circuit Court in Grand Rapids that she must “live with this for the rest of my life.”

Judge Curt Benson sentenced her Thursday to 6 months in jail, with all but 30 days suspended. He called her actions “simply inexcusable.”

Kosakowski’s son hung from the passenger-side front door for nearly 50 yards (48 meters) in December at Chandler Woods Charter Academy’s parking lot in Belmont before he lost his grip and was run over. Authorities say he didn’t want to stay at school.

The boy survived but suffered traumatic injury to his brain.

Arraignment set for man charged after missing child hoax,"CINCINNATI (AP) — A 23-year-old man accused of impersonating a long-missing child is scheduled for arraignment in federal court.

Brian Michael Rini of Medina, Ohio, will go before Magistrate Karen Litkovitz in a Friday afternoon hearing in Cincinnati. He was indicted this week of two counts of lying to federal agents and one count of aggravated identity theft.

He had been arrested earlier on a single false statement count after DNA testing proved he wasn’t Timmothy Pitzen, who disappeared in 2011 at age 6. A message seeking comment was left Thursday with his federal public defender.

The federal magistrate last week cited Rini’s lack of a permanent address, past mental health issues and “a lengthy criminal history” that goes back to age 13 as she ordered him held without bond.

Columbine focuses on healing as questions loom after manhunt,"LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) — A Colorado community changed forever by the attack that killed 13 people at Columbine High School moved ahead Thursday with ceremonies marking the anniversary of the tragedy while awaiting more details on what led a Florida teen “infatuated” with the shooting to buy a shotgun and kill herself in the snowy foothills nearby.

Many questions remained unanswered about 18-year-old Sol Pais, but a friend disputed the contention by authorities that she posed a threat.

Adrianna Pete painted a complex picture of Pais, saying she was deeply troubled, lonely and often talked about suicide but was also brilliant, kind and a talented artist who loved to draw.

Pete, 19, a college student in Carleton, Michigan, said she met Pais online two years ago through a mutual friend and quickly developed a friendship involving near-daily communication. They met in person twice, once when Pete traveled to Florida and once when Pais went to Michigan.

Pete faulted authorities for overreacting in portraying Pais as a threat based on her activities before her death.

“She never threatened anyone,” Pete said. “There are no credible threats and only assumptions that she was just because the word Columbine was included.”

Pete said Pais had a weird obsession with the Columbine killers but that didn’t mean she was planning an attack. The killers were “someone she could relate to” because they were lonely, not because of their violence, Pete said.

“She would say I hate life, life sucks and that she was very alone,” Pete said. “Then she told me she had it figured out with her parents before so I assumed like she was doing OK … She actually posted about it a lot, wanting to die.”

Two teenagers attacked Columbine on April 20, 1999, killing 12 classmates and a teacher before taking their own lives. They have inspired cult-like admirers, some of whom committed other mass shootings.

The days surrounding the April 20 anniversary of the attack are always emotional for school alumni, their families and the suburban community of Littleton surrounding Columbine. Some survivors describe the experience as an “April fog.”

The manhunt for Pais and the resulting closure of schools added a new layer of anxiety, former Columbine principal Frank DeAngelis said Wednesday after the FBI declared the danger was over.

A religious service Thursday night will begin three days of commemorative events themed “Remember. Reflect. Recommit” leading to a day of community service projects and a ceremony Saturday at a park near the school.

Pais’ body was discovered Wednesday in the mountains outside Denver with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Colorado authorities learned about Pais on Tuesday from an alarmed Miami FBI office that had interviewed people about her obsession with the Columbine shooting.

Dozens of schools, including Columbine, locked their doors for several hours on Tuesday and even more closed altogether on Wednesday.

More than 400,000 students returned to Denver-area schools Thursday, with visible police presence outside buildings.

FBI officials declined Wednesday to discuss Pais’ mental health or detail the comments she made indicating an “infatuation” with the Columbine shooting. An FBI spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request Thursday for more information on Pais’ background or her Columbine-related comments that sparked a rapid law enforcement response.

Officials at her Florida school district said they had no record of Pais being contacted by law enforcement or disciplined in school.

Her family has not spoken publicly but worked with authorities this week.

Pete described Pais as caring and thoughtful, someone who helped with her Spanish homework and sent her a pair of earrings when she was having boyfriend troubles.

When they got together in Miami last summer, they went swimming at the beach, walked the boardwalk and played with stray cats. Almost daily, Pais walked to a store and bought a coffee energy drink. She was obsessed with them, Pete said.

“I believe she was just very mentally ill and had no one but me to confide in and a few people on the internet,” Pete said.

FBI officials said Wednesday they were reviewing all of Pais’ activity in recent weeks, including her social media accounts and other online writing. They confirmed that online material includes a blog featuring hand-written journal entries about the author’s unhappiness and desire to die along with sketches of guns or knives.

Pais did not make threats against a specific school but her history and purchase of a weapon immediately after arriving in Colorado merited a broad response, officials said.

Pais arrived Monday and went directly to a gun store, where she bought a shotgun, authorities said. The purchase apparently followed the legal process, officials said.

That’s according to three people with knowledge of Biden’s plans.

Biden will enter the race as a Democratic front-runner, although the 76-year-old faces questions about his age and whether his more moderate record fits with a party that has become more liberal.

The announcement is expected as early as Wednesday and would cap months of deliberation over his political future.

The people with knowledge of Biden’s plans insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

Mueller reveals Trump’s attempts to choke off Russia probe,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Public at last, special counsel Robert Mueller’s report revealed to a waiting nation Thursday that President Donald Trump tried to seize control of the Russia probe and force Mueller’s removal to stop him from investigating potential obstruction of justice by the president. Trump was largely thwarted by those around him who refused to go along.

Mueller laid out multiple episodes in which Trump directed others to influence or curtail the Russia investigation after the special counsel’s appointment in May 2017. Those efforts “were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests,” Mueller wrote.

After nearly two years, the two-volume, 448-page redacted report made for riveting reading.

In one particularly dramatic moment, Mueller reported that Trump was so agitated at the special counsel’s appointment on May 17, 2017, that he slumped back in his chair and declared: “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I’m f—ed.”

With that, Trump set out to save himself.

In June of that year, Mueller wrote, Trump directed White House Counsel Don McGahn to call Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversaw the probe, and say that Mueller must be ousted because he had conflicts of interest. McGahn refused — deciding he would sooner resign than trigger a potential crisis akin to the Saturday Night Massacre of firings during the Watergate era.

Two days later, the president made another attempt to alter the course of the investigation, meeting with former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and dictating a message for him to relay to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The message: Sessions would publicly call the investigation “very unfair” to the president, declare Trump did nothing wrong and say Mueller should limit his probe to “investigating election meddling for future elections.” The message was never delivered.

The report’s bottom line largely tracked the findings revealed in Attorney General William Barr’s four-page memo released a month ago — no collusion with Russia but no clear verdict on obstruction — but it added new layers of detail about Trump’s efforts to thwart the investigation. Looking ahead, both sides were already using the findings to amplify well-rehearsed arguments about Trump’s conduct, Republicans casting him as a victim of harassment and Democrats depicting the president as stepping far over the line to derail the investigation.

The Justice Department released its redacted version of the report about 90 minutes after Barr offered his own final assessment of the findings at a testy news conference. The nation, Congress and Trump’s White House consumed it voraciously — online, via a compact disc delivered to legislators and in loose-leaf binders distributed to reporters.

The release represented a moment of closure nearly two years in the making but also the starting bell for a new round of partisan warfare.

A defiant Trump pronounced it “a good day” and tweeted “Game Over” in a typeface mimicking the “Game of Thrones” logo. By late afternoon, he was airborne for his Mar-a-Lago private club in Florida with wife Melania for the holiday weekend.

Top Republicans in Congress saw vindication, too.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said it was time to move on from Democrats’ effort to “vilify a political opponent.” The California lawmaker said the report failed to deliver the “imaginary evidence” incriminating Trump that Democrats had sought.

Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said Republicans should turn the tables and “investigate the liars who instigated this sham investigation.”

But Democrats cried foul over Barr’s preemptive press conference and said the report revealed troubling details about Trump’s conduct in the White House.

In a joint statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wrote that “one thing is clear: Attorney General Barr presented a conclusion that the president did not obstruct justice while Mueller’s report appears to undercut that finding.”

House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler added that the report “outlines disturbing evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction of justice and other misconduct.” He sent a letter to the Justice Department requesting that Mueller himself testify before his panel “no later than May 23” and said he’d be issuing a subpoena for the full special counsel report and the underlying materials.

Signaling battles ahead, Nadler earlier called the investigation “incredibly thorough” work that would preserve evidence for future probes.

Barr said he wouldn’t object to Mueller testifying.

Trump himself was never questioned in person, but the report’s appendix includes 12 pages of his written responses to queries from Mueller’s team.

Mueller deemed Trump’s written answers — rife with iterations of “I don’t recall” — to be “inadequate.” He considered issuing a subpoena to force the president to appear in person but decided against it after weighing the likelihood of a long legal battle.

In his written answers, Trump said his comment during a 2016 political rally asking Russian hackers to help find emails scrubbed from Hillary Clinton’s private server was made “in jest and sarcastically” and said he did not recall being told during the campaign of any Russian effort to infiltrate or hack computer systems.

But Mueller said that within five hours of Trump’s comment, Russian military intelligence officers were targeting email accounts connected to Clinton’s office.

Mueller evaluated 10 episodes for possible obstruction of justice, and said he could not conclusively determine that Trump had committed criminal obstruction. The episodes included Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey, the president’s directive to subordinates to have Mueller fired and efforts to encourage witnesses not to cooperate.

Sessions was so affected by Trump’s frequent criticism of him for recusing himself from the investigation that he kept a resignation letter “with him in his pocket every time he went to the White House,” Mueller said.

The president’s lawyers have said Trump’s conduct fell within his constitutional powers, but Mueller’s team deemed the episodes deserving of scrutiny for potential criminal acts.

As for the question of whether the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign, Mueller wrote that the campaign “expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.”

But Mueller said investigators concluded, “While the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges.”

Workers at a Russian troll farm contacted Trump’s campaign, claiming to be political activists for conservative grassroots organizations, and asked for signs and other campaign materials to use at rallies. While volunteers provided some of those materials — and set aside a number of signs — investigators don’t believe any Trump campaign officials knew the requests were coming from foreign nationals, Mueller wrote.

Mueller wrote that investigators “did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”

Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston, stressed that Mueller didn’t think the president’s obligations to run the executive branch entitled him to absolute immunity from prosecution. But to find that the president obstructed justice, he said, Mueller would have needed much clearer evidence that the president acted solely with “corrupt intent.”

“The evidence was sort of muddled,” Blackman said, adding that the president’s actions had multiple motivations.

The report laid out some of Mueller’s reasoning for drawing no conclusion on the question of obstruction.

Mueller wrote that he would have exonerated Trump if he could, but he wasn’t able to do that given the evidence he uncovered. And he said the Justice Department’s standing opinion that a sitting president couldn’t be indicted meant he also couldn’t recommend Trump be criminally charged, even in secret.

Trump’s written responses addressed no questions about obstruction of justice, as was part of an agreement with Trump’s legal team.

He told Mueller he had “no recollection” of learning in advance about the much-scrutinized Trump Tower meeting between campaign officials and a Russian lawyer. He also said he had no recollection of knowledge about emails setting up the meeting that promised dirt on Clinton’s Democratic campaign.

He broadly denied knowing of any foreign government trying to help his campaign, including the Russian government. He said he was aware of some reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin had made “complimentary statements” about him.

It wasn’t just Trump under the microscope. But Mueller wrote that he believed prosecutors would be unlikely to meet the burden of proof to show that Donald Trump Jr. and other participants in the Trump Tower meeting “had general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful.” Nor did Mueller’s probe develop evidence that they knew that foreign contributions to campaigns were illegal or other particulars of federal law.

Barr’s contention that the report contained only “limited redactions” applied more to the obstruction of justice section than its look at Russian election meddling. Overall, about 40 percent of the pages contained at least something that was blocked out, mostly to protect ongoing investigations. Barr had said that he would redact grand jury information and material related to investigations, privacy and intelligence.

President who cried wolf? Real border alarms now seem hollow,"WASHINGTON (AP) — When President Donald Trump insisted last year that America’s southern border was in crisis, his warnings landed with a thud.

Making unverified claims about “unknown Middle Easterners” and prayer rugs found by ranchers, Trump drew eye rolls from Democrats and many others, who derided his tactics as little more than an election-year stunt .

Now, six months later, Trump’s new cries of alarm are again being met with skepticism, though the situation at the border has indeed deteriorated. Lawmakers of both parties agree there is a genuine humanitarian emergency, with federal authorities and nonprofits unable to cope with the tens of thousands of Central American families seeking refuge in the U.S.

It’s a classic case of the boy who cried wolf.

No wonder the public is skeptical, says Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif. “There’s a humanitarian crisis and I think that there are steps we can take to help. Unfortunately the president has never been an honest broker about any of these solutions. He plays fast and loose with the facts.”

Trump and members of his administration have spent years blaming Democrats for failing to work with them to close what they describe as “loopholes” that encourage migrants to make the dangerous trek to the U.S. and that restrict the government’s ability to remove them once they arrive.

“Democrats in Congress must return from their Vacations and change the Immigration Laws, or the Border, despite the great job being done by Border Patrol, will only get worse,” Trump tweeted again on Wednesday.

But Democratic lawmakers and immigration activists say that, after years of incendiary comments and false starts, there is little appetite for cooperation with Trump on an issue that has vexed lawmakers for decades. The president, they say, has not only squandered potential goodwill, but also failed to demonstrate that he is genuinely interested in potential solutions.

Many also accuse the president of simply stoking the issue for his political benefit to energize his base and boost turnout ahead of his 2020 re-election race.

Democrats note, in particular, the president’s threat to send migrants immigration-friendly “sanctuary cities” in an effort to punish political foes as the starkest example of why they don’t trust the administration.

“The problem is he has made it political. He’s made it all about political revenge,” said Rep. Nanette Barragan, D-Calif., who sits on the Homeland Security committee. She said that Democrats would be happy to work with the White House to address the problem, but not under the current circumstances.

“If he’s truly interested in the southern border right now and what has been happening, then these policies need to change, this rhetoric has to change,” she said.

Aguilar, the congressman from California, said that if the White House were really serious, it would propose legislative language on potential changes it wants for Congress to review and debate.

There does appear at least to be discussion underway.

Last Wednesday, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan met with several Democratic senators to discuss border security, said an aide to No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Dick Durbin of Illinois. The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a closed door meeting, said the talks were in early stages.

Other senators in the one-hour session included California’s Dianne Feinstein, in whose office the session was held, Jon Tester of Montana and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.

For the most part, critics say, Trump has instead pushed ideas that have made things worse. Those include cutting off aid money to the Central American countries that migrants are fleeing; limiting asylum claims at legal ports of entry, which encourages migrants to cross illegally elsewhere, and threatening to completely close southern border crossings, which could have the same affect.

“The problem is we’re dealing with an administration that doesn’t want a solution,” said Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz. He argued the administration could be doing far more to address the immediate crisis including incentivizing people to apply for asylum in their home countries so they don’t make the journey north, dedicating more resources to border facilities to process new arrivals and hiring more immigration judges to clear the backlog of asylum cases.

Some have also called for mobilizing FEMA and the Red Cross to help provide housing and health care as the government would in a natural disaster.

“Solutions aren’t really that hard,” Gallego said.

Meanwhile, Trump continues to portray asylum-seekers as dangerous figures trying to game the U.S. immigration system.

“You look at some of these people; you want protection from them. And they’re saying, ‘We need protection from our country,” Trump said this week. “It’s a big con job. That’s what it is.”

“Trump’s rhetoric poisons the well for any deal making,” said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, a liberal immigration reform group, which soured on working with Trump after he backed out of a bipartisan 2018 congressional deal that would have provided legal protection for hundreds of thousands of “dreamer” immigrants brought to the country as children and now here illegally.

“He’s leveraging chaos for political advantage,” Sharry said.

Indeed, Sharry said he has a difficult time using the word “crisis” to describe the current situation because it has become so politically charged.

“Here is an asylum emergency at the border,” he said instead.

The White House didn’t respond to requests for comment Wednesday. But in Africa, Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and senior adviser told the AP that “there is no one solution to solving this problem.”

“We have a humanitarian crisis at our southern border of epic proportion,” she said. “Ultimately it’s going to have to be done in Congress to change the laws that enable us to maintain secure borders and ensure that there’s adequate humanitarian assistance and relief for those who are struggling and seeking legitimate asylum in our country.”

‘A good day’: Trump claims victory with Mueller report out,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Before the world glimpsed the redacted version of the special counsel’s report, President Donald Trump tried once more to frame the moment as a political victory.

The 448-page report does include an account of how the president attempted to seize control of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and force out Robert Mueller from leading the inquiry. But that didn’t stop Trump from taking a public victory lap Thursday, declaring at a White House event that he was having “a good day.”

“It was called no collusion, no obstruction. There never was, by the way, and there never will be,” Trump said at a gathering of wounded veterans. “This should never happen to another president again, this hoax.”

Twelve times Trump took to Twitter in the hours before Attorney General William Barr outlined the findings of the report. The president proclaimed his innocence and insisted that the investigation was politically motivated. As soon as Barr concluded his remarks, and more than an hour before Mueller’s report was released, Trump tweeted a taunt over an image inspired by the HBO show “Game of Thrones.”

“No Collusion. No Obstruction,” it said. “For the haters and the radical left Democrats — Game Over.”

It is true that Mueller did not charge that Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia. And Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, in the attorney general’s four-page summary of the Mueller report that was released last month, declined to charge obstruction of justice.

But the two-volume does recount how Trump repeatedly sought to take control of an investigation that has hovered over the first two years of his presidency.

Mueller reported that Trump had been agitated at the investigation from the start. Trump reacted to Mueller’s appointment by saying it was the “end of his presidency.”

The report said that in June 2017, Trump directed White House counsel Don McGahn to call Rosenstein, who oversaw the investigation, and say that Mueller must be ousted because Mueller had conflicts of interest. McGahn refused, deciding he would rather resign than trigger what he regarded as a potential repeat of the Saturday Night Massacre firings from Watergate. During that crisis, President Richard Nixon first ordered his attorney general, and then the deputy, to fire the Watergate special prosecutor; they refused and quit on a weekend, but did not derail the independent investigation or Nixon’s collapse for long.

As for the question of whether Trump’s campaign had colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential race, Mueller wrote: “While the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges.”

At Justice Department headquarters, reporters buzzed around, hearing from Barr and awaiting the Mueller report. A few blocks away, there was calm on one of the defining days of Trump’s presidency

The news media were led into the White House East Room, just before the report came out, for Trump’s appearance with wounded warriors. While newsrooms across the country digested the report, the White House guests, already seated while waiting for the president to arrive, were entertained by the U.S. Marine Band. Among the selections played: “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.”

Democrats criticized Barr for a news conference they said amounted to an attempt to frame the findings before the report was released. But it appeared to be the latest move by Trump and his allies to try and shape the narrative surrounding the investigation — featuring his incessant tweeting of “No Collusion” and his attacks on the credibility of the investigators in hopes of undermining their findings.

The White House seized upon Barr’s four-page summary last month as vindication and played down the contents of the report itself.

“Knockout,” read a text message from Rudy Giuliani, one of the president’s attorneys, to reporters after Barr finished speaking.

A further statement from Giuliani and Trump’s lawyers said “the report itself is nothing more than an attempt to rehash old allegations” and insisted that “the results of the investigation are a total victory for the president.”

Trump’s re-election campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said, “Now the tables have turned, and it’s time to investigate the liars who instigated this sham investigation into President Trump, motivated by political retribution and based on no evidence whatsoever.”

The president and his allies have portrayed House Democrats’ investigations as partisan overreach. They have targeted news outlets and individual reporters they say have promoted the collusion story. The president seethed at a recent political rally that the whole thing was an attempt “to tear up the fabric of our great democracy.”

He has told confidants in recent days that he was certain the full report would back up his claims of vindication but was also convinced that the media would manipulate the findings in an effort to damage him.

Red Sox place Dustin Pedroia on injured list,"BOSTON (WHDH) - The Boston Red Sox will place second baseman Dustin Pedroia on the 10-day injured list, the team announced Thursday night.

Pedroia, 35, began the season on the injured list with left knee inflammation.

After returning from an injury rehab assignment with Single-A Greenville and reinstated from the injured list on April 9, he appeared in six games with Boston.

Pedroia made four starts at second base and two as a designated hitter, going 2-for-20 (.100) with a walk, an RBI, and a run scored.

The three-time World Series champion and four-time Rawlings Gold Glove Award winner appeared in only three major league games in 2018 due to a pair of stints on the disabled list.

To fill Pedroia’s spot on the active 25-man roster, the club will recall right-handed pitcher Marcus Walden from Triple-A Pawtucket prior to Friday’s game against the Tampa Bay Rays.

BOSTON (WHDH) - Former New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski made sure to leave one last mark on the organization as he entered retirement.

During the Boston Red Sox home opener at Fenway Park, Gronkowski decided to use the Patriots’ sixth Lombardi Trophy as a baseball bat.

In video released by the Patriots on Twitter, Gronkowski is seen using the trophy to bunt a baseball thrown by wide receiver Julian Edelman as they practiced their first pitches for the game.

Gronkowski’s teammates, including cornerback Jascon McCourty and defensive back Duron Harmon, watched this unfold and didn’t think he would actually swing the trophy.

“We’re thinking, ‘He’s not going to swing the bat. He’s not going to do it,'” Harmon recalled.

The hit left the football part of the Lombardi Trophy dented.

McCourty referred to the dent as “Gronkowski’s parting gift.”

“He has now left an everlasting mark so people will never forget that he was a part of that championship team,” Harmon added.

Several players attended the home opener on April 9 to celebrate their Super Bowll LIII victory against the Los Angeles Rams.

Judge bars release of Kraft massage videos before hearing,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Prosecutors can’t release undercover video of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and others allegedly receiving sex acts at a Florida massage parlor until a Florida judge rules later this month.

Circuit Judge Joseph Marx on Wednesday barred the release of any video from the Orchids of Asia Day Spa before an April 29 hearing where he will hear from all parties, the Palm Beach Post reported.

Palm Beach County prosecutors had filed a notice in a related case saying they believe the videos are public records under Florida law and plan to release pixilated versions — a move Kraft’s attorneys quickly moved to block, accusing prosecutors of apparent “gross prosecutorial misconduct.”

Kraft was charged in February with two misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution for allegedly paying for sex at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Florida. He has pleaded not guilty. Twenty-four other alleged Orchids of Asia customers were similarly charged.

Palm Beach State Attorney David Aronberg wrote to the court in the related case that there is no legal basis to block the videos’ release. The Associated Press and numerous other media outlets have requested the videos.

“Absent a Court order, the State will be releasing the requested public records” after they are pixilated, Aronberg wrote. His spokesman, Mike Edmondson, said the release is not imminent as the office is processing numerous public records requests from the case.

Defense attorney Jack Goldberger quickly sent a letter to the judge overseeing Kraft’s case, writing that prosecutors are trying to “evade judicial review and end run” around a promise he says they made to await a court ruling on whether the videos are a public record.

“The State’s bad faith attempt to circumvent judicial review by simply releasing the Videos” before the judge rules “is an affront to justice and grossly unethical,” Goldberger wrote.

David S. Weinstein, a defense attorney and former prosecutor who is not involved in the case, said “there is still no guarantee that the tapes will be released.” Prosecutors “are simply stating that they are complying with their duties under the public records laws and they won’t be withholding the tapes,” he said. Even if the trial judge orders the videos’ release, Kraft’s attorneys could appeal, he said.

Kraft, 77, is accused of paying for sex acts at the spa twice in January. While fighting the charges, he recently issued an apology saying he had disappointed his family, friends, co-workers, fans “and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard.”

Kraft said he has “extraordinary respect for women,” adding that his morals were shaped by his late wife, who died in 2011.

According to police records, Kraft, who is worth $6 billion, was chauffeured to the Orchids of Asia spa on the evening of Jan. 19, where officers secretly recorded him engaging in a sex act and then handing over an undetermined amount of cash.

Investigators said Kraft returned 17 hours later and was again videotaped engaging in sex acts before paying with a $100 bill and another bill, police said.

Hours later, he was in Kansas City for the AFC Championship game, where his Patriots defeated the Chiefs. His team then won the Super Bowl in Atlanta, the Patriots’ sixth NFL championship under his ownership.

Goldberger has previously accused Jupiter police of having “deliberately misrepresented” facts used to get a judge to approve the warrant allowing the cameras’ secret installation. Officers used an undisclosed ruse to gain access to the spa days before Kraft’s visits.

Jupiter was part of a multicounty investigation of massage parlor prostitution and possible human trafficking that resulted with the arrests of about 300 men and the closure of 10 spas. The spa owners have been charged with felonies. Prosecutors have conceded they found no evidence of human trafficking at the Jupiter spa.

Goldberger also said officers did not exhaust less-invasive means of investigating the spa, and Florida law says audio surveillance such as wiretaps should only be used for serious felonies such as murder or kidnapping and does not list prostitution.

Prosecutors have offered to drop the charges if Kraft enters a diversion program for first-time offenders, as some others charged have. That would include an admission he would be found guilty if the case went to trial, a $5,000 fine, 100 hours of community service and attendance in a class on the dangers of prostitution and its connection to human trafficking. He would also have to make a court appearance and be tested for sexually transmitted diseases.

Prosecutors have said the fine and community service are required by law and are not negotiable.
